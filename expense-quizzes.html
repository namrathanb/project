                            Below, we have provided a brief description of the three spending personality types you could receive from our questionnaire.
                            The purpose of our questionnaire is to help you recognize your spending type, and address any challenges that could arise from it.
                            After completing our questionnaire, please utilize our budget calculator considering your spending type!

                        <h3>Saver</h3>
                            <p class="ssExplained">Savers are conservative by nature, and don't take big risks with investments or large purchases.
                                Savers fall on a continuum, spanning from those who avoid spending at all costs, to those who
                                generally save but don't shy away from spending on things that are deemed as valuable to them.
                                They typically don't spend money unnecessarily, and look to get good value out of the money they
                                are spending.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Spender</h3>
                            <p class="ssExplained">Spenders are more willing to spend money on unnecessary things, as they tend to not worry as much
                                about their financial obligations. Spenders are constnatly looking for good bargains regardless of their
                                financial status. They often get by with little financial literacy, but manage. When it comes to investing,
                                they are comfortable spending money and are willing to take big risks.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Debtor</h3>
                            <p class="ssExplained">Debtors typically spend more money than they can earn while not putting much thought into invesments and
                                their financial obligations. They fail to keep tabs on what they spend and where they spend it. Debtors develop emotional
                                satisfaction from spending money. Debtors also fail to take advantage of any bonuses given to them.
