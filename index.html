                    Welcome to our expense tracker website!
                    We will begin by asking you a few questions regarding your
                    financial situation before we analyze your expenditure.
                    The expense tracker questionnaire will help you break down your weekly/monthly
                    spendings. It will then suggest certain habits depending on your spending style.
                    We hope to make the process of money management less daunting! In addition to the questionnaire, 
                    we have created an interactive budget calculator that can be used for your personal expenses!
